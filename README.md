# TwoSum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
This code is implemented by sorting the numbers first and creates a new array that excludes values in the sorted array
that is greater than the taget. The purpose of this is to shorten the array, so that in average cases the array will be 
smaller.
